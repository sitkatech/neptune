            Effectively no trash is observed in the assessment area. There may be some small pieces in the area, but they are not obvious at first glance and one individual could
            easily clean up all trash observed in a very short timeframe.

            Predominantly free of trash except for a few pieces that are easily observed in the assessment area. The trash could be collected by one or two individuals in a short

            Trash is widely/evenly distributed and/or small accumulations are visible on the street, sidewalks, or inlets. It would take a more organized effort to remove all trash
            from the area.

            Trash is continuously seen through the assessment area, with large piles and a strong impression of lack of concern for litter in the area. There is often significant
            litter along gutters. It would take a large number of people during an organized effort to remove all trash from the area.
