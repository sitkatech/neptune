# Some tips:
# * The lines that start with # are comments
# * URLs are case-senitive
# * The /$ means the match is at the end of the URL path
# * $ at the end means exact path match, which we want to avoid having "Index" match "IndexData"
# * Don't have any extra blank lines because "A blank line indicates a new user agent section", use # for comment space
# * There should be one blank line before each User-agent tag
# * Sitemap: directive
# ** Independent of User-agent
# ** Must be a full URL
# ** Can be more than one
