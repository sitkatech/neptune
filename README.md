Neptune is Sitka Technology Group's service which builds on the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency's (TRPA) EIP Project Tracker.

Neptune tracks conservation and natural resource project performance and expenditures, and helps managers visualize results at the program level. It is used to track project lifecycles from planning through design to final reporting. The platform is uniquely suited to track and share high-level details of a suite of conservation projects, including:

- Stormwater management
- Habitat restoration
- Bike/pedestrian trail improvements
- Transportation coordination 

Leading organizations, like Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, rely on the platform to share information about all current and completed projects, simplify performance tracking, and build and maintain trust with legislators, partner agencies, and the general public.
